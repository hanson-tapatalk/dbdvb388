</p><p>
1.2 Notices. The Software must contain vBulletin Solutions’ copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software, unless a Branding Free License is purchased.
</p><p>
1.3 Illegal Activity. You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity where the Software is accessed and/or used. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.
</p><p>

<h2>19. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.</h2>
<p>
This Section 19 sets forth specific provisions related to the Software and the License as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and conditions. This Section 19 only applies if you are domiciled in the E.U. To the extent that any provision in this Section 19 is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this Section will supersede such other terms or conditions.
</p><p>
19.1 No Prejudice, E.U. Provisions.
</p><p>
19.1.1 No Transfer. YOU WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN, OR TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN. You may, however, permanently transfer all your rights to use the Software (excluding Services, access to product Updates, discounts, and the use of customer support and forums) to another individual or legal entity provided that: (a) you also transfer (i) this Agreement; (ii) the license number(s), the Software affixed to media provided by vBulletin Solutions or its authorized reseller, and all other software or hardware bundled, packaged, or pre-installed with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and prior versions; (b) you retain no Updates or copies, including backups and copies stored on a Computer or in the cloud; and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions under which you purchased the License to the Software. For the purpose of clarity, other vBulletin products and services, including support contracts, access to product updates, discounts, and the use of support forums are non-transferable. Prior to a transfer, vBulletin Solutions might require that you and the receiving party confirm in writing your compliance with this Agreement, provide vBulletin Solutions with information about yourselves, and register as end-users of the Software. Allow 4-6 weeks to effect the transfer. Prior to any transfer, you must contact vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department at <a href="sales@vbulletin.com">sales@vbulletin.com</a>. Upon transfer of the Software, your License is automatically terminated.
</p><p>
19.1.2 This Agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those dealing as consumers.
</p><p>
19.1.3 This Agreement, and in particular, this Section 19.1.3, is intended to describe your rights (including your statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with your use of the Software. If your statutory rights are greater than this description, your statutory rights will apply. If you obtained the Software in the E.U., you usually reside in the E.U., and you are a consumer (that is you use the Software for personal, non-business related purposes), then Section 7 does not apply to your purchase and use of the Software. Instead, vBulletin Solutions warrants for a period of two (2) years from purchase that the Software provides the functionalities when used on the recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY IF THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To make a warranty claim, you must notify the vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department at <a href="sales@vbulletin.com">sales@vbulletin.com</a> during this two (2) year period, providing details or proof of purchase of the Software. vBulletin Solutions will verify with you whether there is a defect in the Software or advise you that the error arises because you have not installed the Software correctly (in which case, vBulletin Solutions will assist you). If there is a defect in the Software, you may request from vBulletin Solutions either a refund or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event your warranty details are not substantiated, vBulletin Solutions will meet your request for replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for vBulletin Solutions to do so, in which case vBulletin Solutions will provide you with a refund. For warranty assistance, please contact the vBulletin Solutions Customer Support Department.
</p><p>
The provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any damages claims you make in respect of your use of the Software. vBulletin Solutions may be liable if so determined by a court of competent jurisdiction for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a material breach by vBulletin Solutions of this Agreement. You are advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid, reduce or otherwise mitigate damages, in particular by making one (1) back-up copy of the Software and your computer data, and we strongly recommend purchasing Updates, as they often include important security patches.
